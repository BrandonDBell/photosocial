SnapShot is a lite social media website revolving around uploading photos and talking to other users.
  
Programmed by Nathan Butler and Brandon Bell

known bugs:
  Both update user and sign out do not work. We spent a long time on these and even went to Josh to ask him a few questions and he couldn't help us out either.
  The update for votes is messed up right now so therefore the code that should work, but doesn't, is currently taken out.
